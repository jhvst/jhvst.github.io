    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Ponkila</h3>
        <p><small>Jul 2017 - <b>Present</b> | Entrepreneur | 🇫🇮 Muhos, Finland</small></p>
        <p>Wholly-owned by me, Ponkila is an LLC that initially specialized in software contracting in <a
            href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. More recently, Ponkila has concentrated on Linux operating system
          development using NixOS. Client projects are not listed on this page.</p>
        <p>As notable merit, Ponkila was invited in May 2018 to on-site interviews of <a
            href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> (acceptance rate 2%), over a developer tool project for
          reducing 5G network end-to-end latency.</p>
        <p>In January 2023, Ponkila received grants from the <a href="https://esp.ethereum.foundation/">Ethereum
            Foundation's Ecosystem Support Program</a> and <a href="https://ssv.network/">ssv.network</a>
          towards a project
          called <a href="https://github.com/ponkila/HomestakerOS">HomestakerOS</a>, a web UI for generating an
          integrated network of ephemeral Linux servers using <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>. Ponkila Oy also
          has
          Ethereum RPC lease contracts with <a href="https://threshold.network/">threshold.network</a> and <a
            href="https://lido.fi/">Lido</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Ponkila has developed a project called <a href="https://github.com/majbacka-labs/nixos.fi">Nixie</a>, which
          integrates NixOS flake configurations with PXE server for booting ephemeral
          operating systems.</p>

        <h3>Certora</h3>
        <p><small>Jul 2021 - Sep 2021 | Software Engineer | 🇮🇱 Tel Aviv, Israel</small></p>
        <p>Certora provides security analysis tools for Smart Contracts. Certora has unique technology called Certora
          Prover capable of checking at compile-time that all executions of a Smart Contract fulfill a set of security
          rules.</p>
        <p>I worked at Certora in between finishing my MSc and starting my DPhil. I worked on the Language Server
          Protocol implementation of Certora's prover language.</p>

        <h3>OneSignal</h3>
        <p><small>Jun 2016 - Jan 2017 | Software Engineer Intern | 🇺🇸 Mountain View, United States of America</small>
        </p>
        <p>OneSignal (Y Combinator S11) is a push notification delivery platform. During my time at OneSignal, I
          developed the OneSignal admin panel. Customers' feature requests and bug complaints were forwarded to me from

        <h3>Memebox</h3>
        <p><small>Feb 2016 - Jun 2016 | Software Engineer Intern | 🇺🇸 San Francisco, United States of America</small>
        </p>
        <p>I relocated to San Francisco during my freshman year through an internship program called <a
            href="https://startuplifers.org/">Startuplifers</a>, which connects Finnish university students with
          startups for work. The program has an acceptance rate of about 10%. I am one of the youngest students accepted
          into the program.
        <p>
        <p>Memebox (Y Combinator W14) is an eCommerce startup for Asian beauty products. My responsibilities included
          contributing to their eCommerce platform written in Go and creating an admin dashboard to it from scratch. I
          was responsible for architecting, deployment and servicing of the admin dashboard and onboarding of a new
          intern to contribute to the project.</p>

        <h3>Finnish Defence Forces</h3>
        <p><small>Mar 2015 - Sep 2015 | Software Developer | 🇫🇮 Santahamina, Finland (<a
              href="https://intti.fi/erityistehtavat">EKOMJ</a>)</small></p>
        <p>I served my mandatory military service as a programmer. I was one of three programmers accepted through
          technical interviews, to which 12 conscripts were invited from however many applied from 22'000.</p>
        <p>During my stay, I was part of an engineering team of five. Our team transitioned Defence Forces from paper to
          digital questionnaires. The software is nowadays used by conscripts and officers nationwide.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Juuso Haavisto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Achievement">NY</a></h3>
        <p><small>Jan 2013 - Dec 2014 | Software Contractor | 🇫🇮 Muhos, Finland</small></p>
        <p>At the age of 17, I started a sole proprietorship through school entrepreneurship program. Some of the
          software which I created included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a software for buying prestigious Nike sneakers</li>
          <li>a CMR for a local newspaper company</li>
          <li>software which validated and matched 50'000 Finnish domains with company information</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Being an entrepreneur also taught how software engineering isn't all about programming, but about
          communicating to solve other people's problems.</p>

        <p>I later held two speeches about my experience. I was featured in local newspapers. At graduation, I received
          a scholarship for my entrepreneurial efforts.</p>
