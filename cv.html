            <li>a CMR for a local newspaper company</li>
            <li>software which validated and matched 50'000 Finnish domains with company information</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Being an entrepreneur also taught how software engineering isn't all about programming, but about communicating to solve other people's problems.</p>

        <p>I later held two speeches about my experience. I was featured in local newspapers. At graduation, I received a scholarship for my entrepreneurial efforts.</p>
